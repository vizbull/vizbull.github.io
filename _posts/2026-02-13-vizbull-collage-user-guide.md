## 12. Blend Mode (Composite Operations)

The **Blend Mode** control changes how the selected object(s) blend with objects beneath them on the canvas. It uses HTML5 Canvas **globalCompositeOperation** to combine layers—similar to blend modes in Photoshop or other design tools.

### How to use Blend Mode

1. Select one or more objects (shapes, images, text, groups).
2. Open the **Align** dropdown in the top toolbar.
3. Find the **Blend Mode** dropdown at the top of the panel.
4. Choose a blend mode from the list.
5. The effect is applied immediately to the selected object(s).

### Available blend modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Normal** | Default—object draws on top of layers below (no blending). |
| **Multiply** | Darkens; colors multiply together. Good for shadows. |
| **Screen** | Lightens; inverts, multiplies, then inverts. |
| **Overlay** | Combines Multiply and Screen—increases contrast. |
| **Darken** | Keeps darker pixels from both layers. |
| **Lighten** | Keeps lighter pixels from both layers. |
| **Color Dodge** | Brightens by decreasing contrast. |
| **Color Burn** | Darkens by increasing contrast. |
| **Hard Light** | Strong Multiply or Screen depending on source. |
| **Soft Light** | Softer version of Hard Light. |
| **Difference** | Subtracts colors—often produces inverted hues. |
| **Exclusion** | Similar to Difference but with lower contrast. |
| **Hue** | Uses hue of source, saturation & lightness of destination. |
| **Saturation** | Uses saturation of source, hue & lightness of destination. |
| **Color** | Uses hue & saturation of source, lightness of destination. |
| **Luminosity** | Uses lightness of source, hue & saturation of destination. |
| **Source In** | Shows only where source overlaps destination. |
| **Source Out** | Shows only where source does not overlap. |
| **Source Atop** | Source on top, clipped to destination shape. |
| **Destination Over** | Destination drawn over source. |
| **Destination In** | Keeps only overlapping area of destination. |
| **Destination Out** | Keeps only non-overlapping area of destination. |
| **Destination Atop** | Destination on top, clipped to source. |
| **Lighter** | Adds colors (lighter of both). |
| **Copy** | Replaces destination with source. |
| **XOR** | Exclusive-or of source and destination. |

### Tips

- Blend modes work best when objects **overlap**. Stack layers to see the effect.
- **Color**, **Multiply**, and **Overlay** are commonly used for photo effects.
- Blend mode is stored per object and persists when grouping/ungrouping.
- For shapes with images: the **Color** blend mode can tint photos using the shape’s fill color.

- Use **Edit Image** for repositioning/zooming inside the shape.

### Context menu not showing?

- Right-click directly on the object, not on empty canvas.
