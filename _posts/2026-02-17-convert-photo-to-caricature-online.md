## What Does “Convert Photo to Caricature” Mean?

When you convert a photo to caricature, AI analyzes your facial features and creatively exaggerates them — making eyes bigger, smiles brighter, and expressions more playful — while keeping your identity recognizable.

This creates:

- A funny caricature from a selfie  
- A cartoon-style portrait from a real photo  
- A stylized digital artwork ready for printing  
- A creative social media avatar  

Unlike basic filters, AI caricature generators understand facial structure instead of simply applying a preset effect.
